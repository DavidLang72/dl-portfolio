# DavidLang-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my work.  I took a few HTML classes over 20 years ago but life got in the way of any real persuit.  I'm back here starting my Bootcamp Journey and hopefully as I progress I'll be refining this page and adding more (and better polished) examples of my work.

I resisted the urge to dive deep into the internet, locate another portfolio from an established developer and pass it off as my own.  I am very, VERY new at this but I'm feeling no small amount of pride of putting this together, largely on my own.
